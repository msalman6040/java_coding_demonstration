/* This example creates a program to teach a first grade child how to learn subtractions.
The program randomly generates two single-digit integers number1 and number2 with number1 >= number2 
and displays a question such as "What is 9 â€“ 2?" to the student. After the student types the answer, 
the program displays whether the answer is correct.
